### Other technologies utilized:
+ Tailwind CSS styling
+ React.js

+ Node for server runtime environment
+ Express for backend architecture
+ RESTful API principles
+ PostgreSQL for User, Product and Cart data table storage
+ Sequelize for my Object Relational Mapper to database
+ Axios for backend data retrieval to frontend
